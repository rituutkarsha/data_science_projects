# data_science_projects

This Repository contains all the projects I did in my PGP in Data Science and Business Analytics. Apart from the code, it also contains detailed yet to the point analytics reports for each project. The repository is further divided into several subfolders or subtopics which consists of the relevant code, solution and a project report which derives valuable insights and discusses several repurcussions of the solution path chosen. Here is the link to my e-portfolio provided by great learning and UT Austin: - https://eportfolio.mygreatlearning.com/ritu-utkarsha?
The following subfolders/subtopics are included in the repository.
