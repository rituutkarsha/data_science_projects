# data_science_projects

This Repository contains all the projects I did in my PGP in Data Science and Business Analytics. Apart from the code, it also contains detailed yet to the point analytics reports for each project. The repository is further divided into several subfolders or subtopics which consists of the relevant code, solution and a project report which derives valuable insights and discusses several repurcussions of the solution path chosen. Here is the link to my e-portfolio provided by great learning and UT Austin: - https://eportfolio.mygreatlearning.com/ritu-utkarsha?
The following subfolders/subtopics are included in the repository.

Capstone Project
The capstone project involved the amalgation and use of all the tools and techniques learnt so far.I did project on building a  model that aims to enhance HR decision-making by accurately predicting Salary Cost-to-Company (CTC) using machine learning. Leveraging historical data, it estimates CTC for various job roles and experience levels, aiding in budget planning and fair salary negotiations. This user-friendly tool streamlines the hiring process and attracts top talent.

Machine Learning and Ensemble techniques
This project aims to predict the preferred mode of transport for employees commuting to the office based on parameters like age, salary, work experience, and more. Machine Learning techniques such as KNN,logistic regression and ensemble methods are used to draw inferences. Various performance metrics are employed to validate the predictions on both test and train sets.

Predictive Modeling
This project includes two case studies: Gems Price Prediction and Holiday Package Prediction.
Gems Price Prediction: Uses linear regression to predict the price of gems based on multiple variables, helping the company maximize profits.
Holiday Package Prediction: Uses logistic regression to predict whether a customer will purchase a holiday package, enabling targeted marketing efforts.

Data Mining
This project involves two case studies: Bank Marketing and Insurance. It uses clustering, PCA,CART, and Random Forest to draw inferences and validate predictions.Various performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of predictions on Test & Train sets.

Advanced Statistics
This project involves two case studies: Salary Analysis and College Admissions Data. It uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to draw inferences.

Statistical Methods for Decision Making
This project analyzes three case studies: Wholesale Customer Data (Store Sales), University Survey Data, and Manufacturing Shingles Data. It applies Descriptive Statistics, Probability, Probability Distributions, Estimation, and Hypothesis Testing to draw inferences.
